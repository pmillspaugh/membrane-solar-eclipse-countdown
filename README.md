# Membrane solar eclipse countdown

This [membrane](membrane.io) program texts me every morning leading up to the solar eclipse on April 8th 2024 and teaches me a fact about solar eclipses. I posted a [demo and screenshots](https://x.com/pete_millspaugh/status/1775331254096822565) on Twitter.

The program uses Membrane's built-in `cron`, `sms`, and `openai` features. I'm wary of hallucinations, but otherwise this has been a fun way to learn a bit about the solar eclipse as I count down the days.
